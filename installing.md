## Recommended installation

Wp-cli used phar archive. The phar archives are similar in concept to Java JAR archives. For more information [look this](http://php.net/manual/en/phar.using.intro.php).

The recommended way to install WP-CLI is by downloading the Phar build, marking it executable, and placing it on your PATH.


First, download [wp-cli.phar](https://raw.github.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar) using `wget` or `curl`. For example:

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
```

Then, check if it works:

```
php wp-cli.phar --info
```

To be able to type just `wp`, instead of `php wp-cli.phar`, you need to make the file executable and move it to somewhere in your PATH. For example:

```
chmod +x wp-cli.phar
sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
```

Now try running `wp --info`. If WP-CLI is installed successfully, you'll see output like this:

```
PHP binary:    /usr/bin/php5
PHP version:    5.5.9-1ubuntu4.14
php.ini used:   /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
WP-CLI root dir:        /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli
WP-CLI packages dir:    /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli/packages/
WP-CLI global config:   /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli/config.yml
WP-CLI project config:
WP-CLI version: 0.23.0
```

Voila! You're now an official WP-CLI user.

Wondering what to do next? Check out the [quick start guide](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/quick-start/) for a short introduction and some example usage.

### Updating WP-CLI

If you have installed WP-CLI using the recommended Phar method, you can update it at any time by running `wp cli update` (although if WP-CLI is owned by root, that may be `sudo wp cli update`). If you installed WP-CLI using the Git or Composer-based installations, see the specific instructions for updating associated with each method below.  

When you run `wp cli update`, you'll be prompted to confirm that you wish to update with a message similar to the following:

```
You have version 0.21.1. Would you like to update to 0.23.1? [y/n]
```

After you accept, you should see a success message:

```
Success: Updated WP-CLI to 0.23.1
```

If you're already running the latest version of WP-CLI, you'll see this message:

```
WP-CLI is at the latest version.
```

Want to live life on the edge? Run `wp cli update --nightly` to use the latest nightly build of WP-CLI. The nightly build is more or less stable enough for you to use in your local environment, and always includes the latest and greatest.

For more information about `wp cli update`, including flags and options that can be used, read the full [docs page on the update command](https://wp-cli.org/commands/cli/update/).

### Tab completions

WP-CLI also comes with a tab completion script for Bash and ZSH. Just download [wp-completion.bash](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/raw/master/utils/wp-completion.bash) and source it from `~/.bash_profile`:

```
source /FULL/PATH/TO/wp-completion.bash
```

Don't forget to run `source ~/.bash_profile` afterwards.

## Alternative installation methods

### Installing nightly via Phar

The "nightly" is the bleeding-edge version of WP-CLI, built straight from the [master branch](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/commits/master).

Just follow the normal [installation instructions](/#install), except change the URL to the phar file:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli-nightly.phar>

### Installing via Composer

**As part of a project**

Add the following line to your projects `composer.json` file:

    "require" : {
    	"wp-cli/wp-cli" : "~0.22",
    	"psy/psysh" : "~0.6"
    }

where the `psy/psysh` package is just a _suggestion_ by the WP CLI package and _optional_.

Optionally (if run on a server or for e.g. in a virtual machine locally) you can automate setting up the command and making it available in the users path. Let's assume _Composer_ installed into `/var/www/vendor`, we can add the following `scripts`/commands to the `composer.json` file. The second and third line set up [bash completion](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/blob/master/utils/wp-completion.bash) so we don't have to remember every single command:

    "scripts" : {
    	"post-install-cmd" : [
    		"[[ -f /usr/bin/wp ]] || sudo ln -s /var/www/vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli/bin/wp /usr/bin/wp",
    		"source /var/www/vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli/utils/wp-completion.bash",
        "[[ -f ~/.bash_profile ]] || touch ~/.bash_profile",
    		"source ~/.bash_profile"
    	]
    }

Above script assumes that your current shell is `bash`, which might not be the case for all users. Example for a vagrant box (added to the `scripts`-block):

    cat /etc/passwd | grep $(whoami)
    vagrant:x:1000:1000::/home/vagrant:/bin/bash

In case you got `bash` available and installed for your OS, you can switch dynamically:

    "scripts" : {
    	"post-update-cmd" : [
    		"/bin/bash -c \"[[ -f /usr/local/bin/wp ]] || sudo ln -s /var/www/vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli/bin/wp /usr/bin/wp\"",
    		"/bin/bash -c \"source /var/www/vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli/utils/wp-completion.bash\"",
        "/bin/bash -c \"[[ -f ~/.bash_profile ]] || touch ~/.bash_profile\"",
    		"/bin/bash -c \"source ~/.bash_profile\""
    	]
    }

**As a project**

Needs `php` and `composer` (or `php composer.phar`) set up as console commands.

    composer create-project wp-cli/wp-cli --prefer-source

Then run `wp-cli/bin/wp` or add `wp-cli/bin` folder to `PATH` for global `wp` command (on Windows, use `wp-cli/bin/wp.bat` instead).

To update, you'll need to:

    cd wp-cli
    git pull origin master
    composer install

**Global require**

If you prefer to have PHP tools installed globally via Composer and have something like `~/.composer/vendor/bin` in your PATH (or `C:\Users\you\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin` on Windows), you can just run:

    composer global require wp-cli/wp-cli

To update everything globally, run `composer global update`.

**Installing a specific version**

If you want to install a specific version of WP-CLI then append the version numbers behind the packages


    composer create-project wp-cli/wp-cli:0.22.0 --no-dev

The version must be in a [format](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#version) that Composer can understand and can be found on [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/wp-cli/wp-cli).

**Installing bleeding-edge**

If you want to install bleeding-edge then use `dev-master`:

    composer create-project wp-cli/wp-cli:dev-master --no-dev

#### Installing globally as a project

You can specify a custom install path for WP-CLI, like so:

    composer create-project wp-cli/wp-cli /usr/share/wp-cli --no-dev

Then, just symlink the binary:

    sudo ln -s /usr/share/wp-cli/bin/wp /usr/bin/wp

### Installing via Homebrew

    brew install homebrew/php/wp-cli

Here's the [formula](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-php/blob/master/Formula/wp-cli.rb).

### Installing on Windows

Install via [composer as described above](#installing-via-composer) or use the following method.

Make sure you have php installed and [in your path](http://php.net/manual/en/faq.installation.php#faq.installation.addtopath) so you can execute it globally.

Download [wp-cli.phar](https://raw.github.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar) manually and save it to a folder, for example `c:\wp-cli`

Create a file named `wp.bat` in `c:\wp-cli` with the following contents:

    @ECHO OFF
    php "c:/wp-cli/wp-cli.phar" %*

Add `c:\wp-cli` to your path:

    setx path "%path%;c:\wp-cli"

You can now use WP-CLI from anywhere in Windows command line.

### Installing via .deb package

On Debian or Ubuntu, just download and open one of the .deb packages: <https://github.com/wp-cli/builds/tree/gh-pages/deb>


### Using a custom PHP binary

In some cases, like for MAMP installs, you might not want to use the default PHP binary.

To use the latest PHP version provided by MAMP, you'll need to modify your `PATH` environment variable with the following added to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zsh_profile`:

    PHP_VERSION=$(ls /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/ | sort -n | tail -1)
    export PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/${PHP_VERSION}/bin:$PATH

To use a specific PHP version provided by MAMP, you'll need to determine the path to the PHP version's executable, and modify your `PATH` environment variable with the following added to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zsh_profile`:

    export PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.26/bin:$PATH

Note there's no assignment of the `PHP_VERSION` variable in this case, because we aren't dynamically looking up the latest PHP version.

Once you have added that and saved the file, reload the file with:

    source ~/.bash_profile

After you've done that, run `wp --info` to make sure the change has been applied correctly.

For Git and Composer-based WP-CLI installation, you can alternatively set the `WP_CLI_PHP` environment variable, if you don't want to modify `PATH` for some reason.
