# wp term recount

Recalculates number of posts assigned to each term.

In instances where manual updates are made to the terms assigned to posts in the database, the number of posts associated with a term can become out-of-sync with the actual number of posts.

This command runs wp_update_term_count() on the taxonomy's terms to bring the count back to the correct value.

### OPTIONS

&lt;taxonomy&gt;...
: One or more taxonomies to recalculate.

### EXAMPLES

    # Recount posts assigned to each categories and tags
    $ wp term recount category post_tag
    Success: Updated category term count.
    Success: Updated post_tag term count.

    # Recount all listed taxonomies
    $ wp taxonomy list --field=name | xargs wp term recount
    Success: Updated category term count.
    Success: Updated post_tag term count.
    Success: Updated nav_menu term count.
    Success: Updated link_category term count.
    Success: Updated post_format term count.
