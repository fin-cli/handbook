# fin db import

Imports a database from a file or from STDIN.

This command runs on the `after_fin_config_load` hook, after fin-config.php has been loaded into scope.

Runs SQL queries using `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` database credentials specified in fin-config.php. This does not create database by itself and only performs whatever tasks are defined in the SQL.

### OPTIONS

[&lt;file&gt;]
: The name of the SQL file to import. If '-', then reads from STDIN. If omitted, it will look for '{dbname}.sql'.

[\--dbuser=&lt;value&gt;]
: Username to pass to mysql. Defaults to DB_USER.

[\--dbpass=&lt;value&gt;]
: Password to pass to mysql. Defaults to DB_PASSWORD.

[\--&lt;field&gt;=&lt;value&gt;]
: Extra arguments to pass to mysql. [Refer to mysql binary docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-command-options.html).

[\--skip-optimization]
: When using an SQL file, do not include speed optimization such as disabling auto-commit and key checks.

[\--defaults]
: Loads the environment's MySQL option files. Default behavior is to skip loading them to avoid failures due to misconfiguration.

### EXAMPLES

    # Import MySQL from a file.
