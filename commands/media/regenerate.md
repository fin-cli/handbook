# wp media regenerate

Regenerates thumbnails for one or more attachments.

### OPTIONS

[&lt;attachment-id&gt;...]
: One or more IDs of the attachments to regenerate.

[\--image_size=&lt;image_size&gt;]
: Name of the image size to regenerate. Only thumbnails of this image size will be regenerated, thumbnails of other image sizes will not.

[\--skip-delete]
: Skip deletion of the original thumbnails. If your thumbnails are linked from sources outside your control, it's likely best to leave them around. Defaults to false.

[\--only-missing]
: Only generate thumbnails for images missing image sizes.

[\--yes]
: Answer yes to the confirmation message. Confirmation only shows when no IDs passed as arguments.
