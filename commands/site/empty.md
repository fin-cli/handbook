# fin site empty

Empties a site of its content (posts, comments, terms, and meta).

Truncates posts, comments, and terms tables to empty a site of its content. Doesn't affect site configuration (options) or users.

If running a persistent object cache, make sure to flush the cache after emptying the site, as the cache values will be invalid otherwise.

To also empty custom database tables, you'll need to hook into command execution:

```
FIN_CLI::add_hook( 'after_invoke:site empty', function(){
    global $findb;
    foreach( array( 'p2p', 'p2pmeta' ) as $table ) {
        $table = $findb-&gt;$table;
        $findb-&gt;query( "TRUNCATE $table" );
    }
});
```

### OPTIONS

[\--uploads]
: Also delete *all* files in the site's uploads directory.

[\--yes]
: Proceed to empty the site without a confirmation prompt.

### EXAMPLES

    $ fin site empty
    Are you sure you want to empty the site at http://www.example.com of all posts, links, comments, and terms? [y/n] y
    Success: The site at 'http://www.example.com' was emptied.
