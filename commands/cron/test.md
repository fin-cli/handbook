# fin cron test

Tests the FIN Cron spawning system and reports back its status.

This command tests the spawning system by performing the following steps:

* Checks to see if the `DISABLE_FIN_CRON` constant is set; errors if true because FIN-Cron is disabled.
* Checks to see if the `ALTERNATE_FIN_CRON` constant is set; warns if true.
* Attempts to spawn FIN-Cron over HTTP; warns if non 200 response code is returned.

### EXAMPLES

    # Cron test runs successfully.
    $ fin cron test
    Success: FIN-Cron spawning is working as expected.
