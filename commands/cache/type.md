# fin cache type

Attempts to determine which object cache is being used.

Note that the guesses made by this function are based on the FIN_Object_Cache classes that define the 3rd party object cache extension. Changes to those classes could render problems with this function's ability to determine which object cache is being used.

### EXAMPLES
