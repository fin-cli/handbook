# wp core update

Updates WordPress to a newer version.

Defaults to updating WordPress to the latest version.

If you see "Error: Another update is currently in progress.", you may need to run `wp option delete core_updater.lock` after verifying another update isn't actually running.

### OPTIONS

[&lt;zip&gt;]
: Path to zip file to use, instead of downloading from wordpress.org.

[\--minor]
: Only perform updates for minor releases (e.g. update from WP 4.3 to 4.3.3 instead of 4.4.2).

[\--version=&lt;version&gt;]
: Update to a specific version, instead of to the latest version. Alternatively accepts 'nightly'.

[\--force]
: Update even when installed WP version is greater than the requested version.

[\--locale=&lt;locale&gt;]
: Select which language you want to download.
