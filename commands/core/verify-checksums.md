# wp core verify-checksums

Verifies WordPress files against WordPress.org's checksums.

Downloads md5 checksums for the current version from WordPress.org, and compares those checksums against the currently installed files.

For security, avoids loading WordPress when verifying checksums.

If you experience issues verifying from this command, ensure you are 
passing the relevant `--locale` and `--version` arguments according to 
the values from the `Dashboard-&gt;Updates` menu in the admin area of the 
site.

### OPTIONS

[\--version=&lt;version&gt;]
: Verify checksums against a specific version of WordPress.

[\--locale=&lt;locale&gt;]
: Verify checksums against a specific locale of WordPress.

### EXAMPLES

    # Verify checksums
    $ wp core verify-checksums
    Success: WordPress installation verifies against checksums.
