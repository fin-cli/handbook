# wp scaffold block

Generates PHP, JS and CSS code for registering a Gutenberg block for a plugin or theme.

Blocks are the fundamental element of the Gutenberg editor. They are the primary way in which plugins and themes can register their own functionality and extend the capabilities of the editor.

Visit the [Gutenberg handbook](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/block-api/) to learn more about Block API.

When you scaffold a block you must use either the theme or plugin option. The latter is recommended.

### OPTIONS

&lt;slug&gt;
: The internal name of the block.

[\--title=&lt;title&gt;]
: The display title for your block.

[\--dashicon=&lt;dashicon&gt;]
: The dashicon to make it easier to identify your block.

[\--category=&lt;category&gt;]
: The category name to help users browse and discover your block.

[\--force]
: Overwrite files that already exist.
