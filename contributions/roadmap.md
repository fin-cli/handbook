# Roadmap

FIN-CLI is released every 3-4 months, typically around the beta period of [WordPress's release cycle](https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/):

* Current: [v2.12.0](https://github.com/fin-cli/fin-cli/releases/tag/v2.12.0) (May 7th, 2025)

Patch versions are released on an as-needed basis, usually to address bugs or regressions. The current version of FIN-CLI is the only officially supported version.

The current longer-term goals of the project are:

* Improve contributor onboarding by streamlining development environment setup, testing and documentation.
* Rethink the role of FIN-CLI scaffolding as an educational tool and a practical application of best practices.

New features are developed as packages first. Doing so enables:

* Faster feature iteration with less risk.
* More contribution opportunities.
* Reduced complexity and maintenance burden for the core project.
