# WP-CLI Hack Day

Welcome to WP-CLI Hack Day! We appreciate you taking time to contribute to the project.

We'd love to help you submit at least one pull request today. Given this goal, you'll likely want to _start with something small and attainable_. After you've submitted your first pull request for the day, you're welcome to work on something more ambitious.

When do you submit a pull request during Hack Day, please add `Related https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/5859` so we can easily keep track of them. We'll include them in a recap post at the end of the day.

We put together this guide to make contributing as straightforward as possible. Please also join the [#cli channel in WordPress.org Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/C02RP4T41) ([sign up instructions](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/)) to chat with other contributors, for questions, etc.

Your leads for the day are: [schlessera](https://github.com/schlessera), [danielbachhuber](https://github.com/danielbachhuber), [swissspidy](https://github.com/swissspidy)

A few seasoned WP-CLI contributors are also helping out: TBD

## Getting Started

If you normally use WP-CLI on your web host or via Brew, you're most likely using the Phar executable (`wp-cli.phar`). This Phar executable file is the "built", singular version of WP-CLI. It is compiled from a couple dozen repositories in the WP-CLI GitHub organization.

In order to make code changes to WP-CLI, you'll need to set up the `wp-cli-dev` development environment on your local machine. Before you can proceed, though, you'll need to make sure you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), PHP, and a functioning MySQL or MariaDB server on your local machine.

Once the prequisites are met, clone the GitHub repository and run the installation process:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli-dev wp-cli-dev
cd wp-cli-dev
composer install
composer prepare-tests
```

The `wp-cli-dev` installation process clones all of WP-CLI's repositories to your local machine. After the installation process is complete, you can make changes in whichever repository you like. You'll need to fork the repository in order to push your feature branch, however. [GitHub's CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) is pretty helpful for this:

```bash
cd core-command
gh repo fork
```

All WP-CLI pull requests are expected to have tests. [Watch a ~10 minute video introduction](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/5858), or see [running and writing tests](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/contributions/pull-requests/#running-and-writing-tests) for the written version.
