# Wish List

An ongoing list of ideas and potential improvements for wp-cli.org.
wp media replace [media_id] [path_to_new_media]

### WP-CLI

* Split components into logical subpackages (e.g. `wp-cli/search-replace-command`), and require them via Composer. ([from #3652](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/3652)).

### Website

* Redesign! And potentially move to WordPress from Github pages.
* Publish a set of suggested best practices for package maintainers to follow.
* Proxy Github API requests for new WP-CLI versions ([from #3426](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/3426)).

### General Infrastructure

* Run test suite over SSH connection ([previously #2772](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/2772))
